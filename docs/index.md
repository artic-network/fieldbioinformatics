# Welcome to the artic pipeline documentation

The `artic pipeline` is designed to help run the artic bioinformatics protocols; for example the [SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus protocol](https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html).

Features include:

- read filtering
- primer trimming
- amplicon coverage normalisation
- variant calling
- consensus building

There are **2 workflows** baked into this pipeline, one which uses signal data (via [nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish)) and one that does not (via [medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka)).

Use the navigation dropdowns on the left to read more about the pipeline, it's installation and getting started.
